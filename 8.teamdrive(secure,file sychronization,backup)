Objective: 
8. Secure File Synchronization & Backup Using TeamDrive 
To demonstrate file synchronization, backup, multi-device access, and encryption using 
TeamDrive. 
Experiment Steps: 
Step 1: TeamDrive Account Setup & Installation 
1. Create a TeamDrive Account: 
o Visit TeamDrive Registration and sign up. 
o Verify your email and log in. 
2. Install TeamDrive Client Software: 
o Download TeamDrive Desktop Client and install it. 
o Sign in with your credentials. 
Step 2: File Synchronization & Backup 
1. Create a New TeamDrive Space: 
o Open TeamDrive and create a new space (folder) named “BackupTest”. 
o Select a local folder to sync with the cloud. 
2. Upload and Sync a File: 
o Copy a test file (e.g., TestDoc.txt) into the BackupTest folder. 
o Wait for TeamDrive to automatically upload and sync the file. 
3. Verify File Synchronization on Another Device: 
o Log in to TeamDrive Web App on another device. 
o Check if the uploaded file appears in the BackupTest folder. 
4. Modify a File & Check Version Control: 
o Edit TestDoc.txt (add new text) and save it. 
o Check if TeamDrive syncs the updated file. 
o Explore Version History to restore an older version. 
Step 3: Data Recovery & Encryption Analysis 
1. Delete TestDoc.txt from the BackupTest folder. 
2. Open TeamDrive Web App, go to Deleted Files, and restore TestDoc.txt. 
3. Check Encryption Settings to verify end-to-end encryption is enabled. 
Expected Outcome: 
✅ Files sync automatically across devices. 
✅ Version history allows restoring old file versions. 
✅ Deleted files can be recovered. 
✅ End-to-end encryption ensures secure file storage.
