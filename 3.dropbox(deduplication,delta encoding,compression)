Objective: 
To demonstrate cloud storage optimization techniques (Deduplication, Delta Encoding, 
Compression) using Dropbox, a widely used cloud storage service. 
Software & Tools Required: 
 Dropbox Account (Sign up here) 
 Dropbox Desktop App (For Sync & Delta Encoding) 
 Duplicati (For Backup & Deduplication) → Download Here 
 7-Zip / WinRAR (For Compression) 
Experiment Steps: 
Step 1: Deduplication in Dropbox 
1. Upload a file (e.g., report.pdf) to Dropbox via the web or desktop app. 
2. Duplicate the file on your local machine (copy_report.pdf). 
3. Upload the duplicate file to Dropbox and observe that the upload completes instantly (Dropbox 
does not store duplicate copies but creates a reference to the original). 
4. Test with Duplicati: 
o Install Duplicati and configure Dropbox as a backup destination. 
o Backup the same file multiple times and verify that only one copy is stored due to 
deduplication. 
Step 2: Delta Encoding with Dropbox 
1. Upload a large text file (data.txt) to Dropbox. 
2. Modify only a small part of data.txt and save the changes. 
3. Dropbox will not re-upload the entire file but only the changed portion using delta encoding. 
4. Check Dropbox sync speed—it should be significantly faster compared to a full re-upload. 
Step 3: File Compression Before Uploading 
1. Select multiple large files (file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt). 
2. Compress them into a ZIP archive using 7-Zip or WinRAR. 
3. Upload both original and compressed versions to Dropbox. 
4. Compare: 
o Storage space used (compressed vs. uncompressed). 
o Upload time for compressed vs. individual files. 
Expected Outcome: 
✅ Deduplication: Dropbox prevents redundant file storage. 
✅ Delta Encoding: Only modified parts of a file are updated, saving bandwidth. 
✅ Compression: Reduces storage space and speeds up file transfers.
