16. Automating Cloud Backup, Synchronization, and File Transfer Using
Rclone
Objective:
To automate cloud backup, synchronization, and file transfer between different cloud storage
services using Rclone.
Prerequisites:
✅ Windows PC with Admin Privileges
✅ Rclone Installed (Download here: https://rclone.org/downloads/)
✅ At least two cloud storage accounts (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.)
✅ Some test files for backup and synchronization
Experiment Steps
Step 1: Download and Install Rclone
1. Go to the official Rclone website: https://rclone.org/downloads/.
2. Download the Windows version of Rclone.
3. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a preferred location.
4. Open a Command Prompt (cmd) and navigate to the extracted folder.
Step 2: Configure Cloud Storage Accounts in Rclone
1. Open a Command Prompt and type:
rclone config
2. Select 'n' to create a new remote storage connection.
3. Enter a name for the cloud storage (e.g., mydrive for Google Drive).
4. Choose the cloud storage type (e.g., drive for Google Drive, onedrive for OneDrive,
etc.).
5. Follow the prompts to authenticate and authorize Rclone access.
6. Repeat the process for a second cloud storage account if needed.
Step 3: Test Cloud Storage Connection
1. Verify configured accounts by running:
rclone listremotes
2. Check files in a cloud storage account:
rclone ls mydrive:
Step 4: Automate Cloud Backup Using Rclone
1. To copy local files to cloud storage, run:
rclone copy C:\local_folder mydrive:/backup_folder
2. To synchronize local files with cloud storage, run:
rclone sync C:\local_folder mydrive:/sync_folder
3. To automate backups, create a batch file (backup.bat) with the command:
4. @echo off
5. rclone copy C:\local_folder mydrive:/backup_folder
exit
6. Schedule the batch file to run automatically using Windows Task Scheduler.
Step 5: Transfer Files Between Cloud Storage Services
1. To transfer files from Google Drive to OneDrive:
rclone copy mydrive:/backup_folder myonedrive:/backup_folder
2. To synchronize two cloud storage accounts:
rclone sync mydrive:/sync_folder myonedrive:/sync_folder
Testing and Verification
1. Checking Backup Integrity
✅ Compare file size and count in both source and destination.
✅ Run rclone check to verify if files match:
rclone check mydrive:/backup_folder myonedrive:/backup_folder
2. Ensuring Automation Works
✅ Verify Windows Task Scheduler logs to ensure scheduled backups run successfully.
✅ Test synchronization by modifying local files and checking if they update in cloud storage.
Expected Outcome:
✅ Automated file backup to cloud storage without manual intervention.
✅ Secure and synchronized files across multiple cloud storage services.
✅ Efficient cloud file transfers and backup management using Rclone.
