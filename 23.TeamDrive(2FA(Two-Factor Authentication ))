23. Configuring Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) in TeamDrive to Enhance
Security
Objective: Learn how to enable and test Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) in TeamDrive for
enhanced cloud storage security.
Prerequisites:
✅ Windows PC with TeamDrive installed (Download here)
✅ TeamDrive account
✅ Authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or Authy) installed
on a mobile device
Experiment Steps
Step 1: Install and Set Up TeamDrive
1. Download and install the TeamDrive client on your Windows PC.
2. Launch TeamDrive and sign in with your account.
3. If you don’t have an account, create one using your email.
Step 2: Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
1. Open TeamDrive settings by clicking on your profile or security settings.
2. Navigate to Security > Two-Factor Authentication.
3. Click on Enable 2FA.
4. A QR code or setup key will be displayed.
Step 3: Configure 2FA Using an Authenticator App
1. Open Google Authenticator (or your chosen authenticator app) on your mobile device.
2. Tap Add Account > Scan QR Code (or enter the setup key manually).
3. Your authenticator app will generate a 6-digit verification code.
4. Enter the code in TeamDrive to verify and complete the setup.
Step 4: Testing 2FA for Secure Login
1. Sign out from TeamDrive.
2. Attempt to log in again with your credentials.
3. After entering your password, you will be prompted for a 2FA code.
4. Open your authenticator app, enter the code, and verify successful login.
Step 5: Backup and Recovery Options
1. Go to the 2FA settings in TeamDrive.
2. Save backup codes securely in case you lose access to your authenticator app.
3. Test the backup codes by using one instead of the 2FA code.
Testing and Verification
✅ Login Security: Ensure that logging in now requires both a password and an authenticatorgenerated code.
✅ Backup Code Test: Verify that backup codes work if you cannot access your mobile
authenticator.
✅ Unauthorized Access Prevention: Try logging in from another device without 2FA, ensuring
access is denied.
Expected Outcome:
✅ Successfully enabled and tested Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) in TeamDrive.
✅ Enhanced cloud storage security by adding an extra layer of authentication.
✅ Verified backup codes and alternative login methods.
