10. Simulating and Detecting MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) Attacks on 
Cloud Storage Traffic Using Wireshark 
Objective: 
To simulate a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on cloud storage traffic and detect it using 
Wireshark. This experiment demonstrates how an attacker can intercept unencrypted cloud 
storage communication and highlights the importance of TLS encryption and secure 
authentication. 
Tools & Software Required: 
✅ Cloud Storage Service: Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive 
✅ Wireshark: For network traffic analysis (Download here) 
✅ MITM Attack Tools: Ettercap (Linux) or Bettercap (Kali Linux) 
✅ Virtual Machine (Optional): Kali Linux (Attacker System) 
Experiment Setup 
Step 1: Configure Cloud Storage for File Transfer 
1. Create a Cloud Storage Account 
o Sign up for Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive. 
o Install the desktop sync application on your system. 
2. Upload and Download Files 
o Upload a sample text file (e.g., “testfile.txt”) to the cloud. 
o Download the same file to simulate data transmission over the network. 
Step 2: Capture Cloud Storage Traffic Using Wireshark 
1. Start Wireshark on the Victim Machine 
o Open Wireshark and select the Wi-Fi or Ethernet interface. 
o Click Start Capture to begin monitoring network packets. 
2. Filter Cloud Traffic 
o Use the following Wireshark filters to capture cloud storage traffic: 
 Google Drive: tcp.port == 443 && ip.dst_host contains "google" 
 Dropbox: tcp.port == 443 && ip.dst_host contains "dropbox" 
 OneDrive: tcp.port == 443 && ip.dst_host contains "onedrive" 
3. Observe Encrypted (HTTPS) and Unencrypted (HTTP) Traffic 
o If HTTPS is used, the packets are encrypted. 
o If unencrypted HTTP traffic is detected, it is vulnerable to MITM attacks. 
Step 3: Simulate a MITM Attack Using Ettercap (Attacker System) 
(Warning: Perform this experiment only in a controlled, ethical environment!) 
1. Launch Kali Linux (or Linux system with Ettercap installed) 
o Open a terminal and run: 
bash 
CopyEdit 
sudo ettercap -G 
o This opens Ettercap’s graphical interface. 
2. Start ARP Spoofing to Intercept Victim’s Traffic 
o Go to Hosts > Scan for Hosts and select the victim’s IP. 
o Select MITM > ARP Poisoning and enable “Sniff Remote Connections.” 
o Click Start Sniffing to intercept victim’s cloud storage traffic. 
3. Monitor Intercepted Traffic in Wireshark 
o On the attacker machine, run Wireshark to inspect captured packets. 
o If the victim’s connection is unencrypted (HTTP), files and credentials can be extracted. 
Step 4: Detect MITM Attack Using Wireshark on the Victim Machine 
1. Look for Duplicate ARP Replies (ARP Spoofing Detection) 
o In Wireshark, apply the filter: 
bash 
CopyEdit 
arp.duplicate-address-detected 
o If multiple devices claim to have the same MAC address, an ARP Poisoning attack is in 
progress. 
2. Analyze SSL/TLS Handshake Anomalies 
o Apply the filter: 
bash 
CopyEdit 
tls.handshake 
o If an attacker performs SSL stripping, TLS encryption may be downgraded to HTTP, 
making data vulnerable. 
3. Check for Suspicious DNS Responses (DNS Spoofing Detection) 
o Apply the filter: 
bash 
CopyEdit 
dns && ip.src != your_DNS_server 
o If DNS responses originate from an unknown source, a MITM attack is redirecting 
traffic. 
Expected Outcome: 
✅ MITM attacks can intercept unencrypted cloud storage traffic. 
✅ Wireshark detects ARP spoofing and SSL stripping. 
✅ Secure cloud storage traffic (TLS-encrypted) remains unreadable by attackers.
