17. Monitoring and Analyzing Cloud Storage Traffic Using Wireshark
Objective:
To monitor and analyze cloud storage traffic using Wireshark on Windows, identifying security
risks and traffic patterns.
Prerequisites:
✅ Windows PC with Admin Privileges
✅ Wireshark Installed (Download here: https://www.wireshark.org/download.html)
✅ A cloud storage account (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox)
✅ Some test files for upload and download
Experiment Steps
Step 1: Download and Install Wireshark
1. Go to the official Wireshark website: https://www.wireshark.org/download.html.
2. Download the Windows installer and run the setup.
3. Follow the installation instructions and install the necessary network drivers (Npcap).
4. Launch Wireshark after installation.
Step 2: Select the Network Interface
1. Open Wireshark and go to the Capture section.
2. Select the network interface connected to the internet (e.g., Wi-Fi or Ethernet).
3. Click the Start Capture button.
Step 3: Capture Cloud Storage Traffic
1. Open a cloud storage service (Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive) in a web browser or
desktop application.
2. Upload a test file to the cloud storage.
3. Download the same file from the cloud storage.
4. While these actions take place, Wireshark captures the network packets.
5. Click the Stop Capture button once the file transfer is complete.
Step 4: Analyze the Captured Traffic
1. Use the Filter Bar in Wireshark to focus on cloud storage traffic:
o Google Drive: ip.addr == 172.217.0.0/16
o Dropbox: ip.addr == 162.125.0.0/16
o OneDrive: ip.addr == 13.107.0.0/16
2. Apply HTTP and HTTPS filters:
http || tls
3. Identify key packet information:
o Source and Destination IP Addresses
o Protocols (TLS, HTTP, TCP)
o Packet size and timing
Step 5: Detect Security Issues
1. Check for unencrypted traffic (HTTP instead of HTTPS).
2. Identify potential data leaks or unexpected connections.
3. Analyze traffic behavior for abnormal data transfers.
Testing and Verification
1. Identifying Cloud Storage Traffic Patterns
✅ Observe the number of packets sent during upload vs. download.
✅ Identify cloud service IPs from captured packets.
2. Detecting Unsecured Data Transfers
✅ Verify that traffic is encrypted using TLS protocol.
✅ Look for any HTTP traffic, which may indicate security risks.
3. Ensuring Proper Network Security Measures
✅ Check if Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is in use.
✅ Analyze logs for unauthorized access attempts.
Expected Outcome:
✅ Users can monitor cloud storage traffic effectively.
✅ Security vulnerabilities, such as unencrypted data transmission, can be identified.
✅ Understanding of cloud storage data flow and encryption techniques is improved
