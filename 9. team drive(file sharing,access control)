9. Secure File Sharing & Access Control Using TeamDrive 
To demonstrate secure file sharing, collaboration, and permission control using TeamDrive. 
Experiment Steps: 
Step 1: Create a Secure Shared Folder 
1. Open TeamDrive Desktop Client or Web App. 
2. Create a New Space (Shared Folder) named “ProjectDocs”. 
3. Upload a test file (e.g., ProjectPlan.pdf) to the ProjectDocs folder. 
Step 2: Invite Users & Set Access Permissions 
1. Right-click on the “ProjectDocs” space and select “Invite Users”. 
2. Enter the email address of another TeamDrive user. 
3. Assign appropriate access permissions: 
o Read-Only: User can view but not edit. 
o Read & Write: User can view and edit. 
o Full Control: User can modify, delete, and invite others. 
Step 3: Test File Access Control 
1. Log in as the invited user and check if ProjectPlan.pdf is accessible. 
2. Modify the file (if permissions allow) and check if changes sync for all users. 
3. Remove a user’s access and verify they can no longer access the file. 
Expected Outcome: 
✅ Users can securely collaborate on shared files. 
✅ Permissions control who can edit or view documents. 
✅ Revoked users lose access to files immediately.
