Objective: 
6. Cloud Security & Storage Analysis Using CloudMe 
To analyze file storage, synchronization, sharing, security threats, and encryption 
mechanisms using CloudMe, a cloud storage service that supports client-server encryption, 
multi-device access, and file sharing. 
Cloud Service Used: 
✅ CloudMe (Sign up here) 
 Provides cloud storage with synchronization across devices. 
 Supports file sharing via links. 
 Offers client-side encryption for enhanced security. 
Software & Tools Required: 
 CloudMe Web Interface 
 CloudMe Desktop App (for synchronization and client-side encryption) 
 Wireshark (optional, for transport security analysis) 
Experiment Steps: 
Step 1: File Storage & Synchronization 
1. Create a CloudMe account and log in. 
2. Install the CloudMe Desktop App on your computer. 
3. Upload a test file (testfile.txt) to CloudMe via the web interface. 
4. Verify that the file appears in the CloudMe folder on your desktop app, confirming 
synchronization. 
Step 2: File Sharing & Security Risks 
1. Right-click on testfile.txt in the CloudMe web interface. 
2. Select “Share” and generate a public link. 
3. Try accessing the link from another browser or device without logging in. 
4. Test security enhancement by adding a password to the shared link and verifying unauthorized 
users cannot access it. 
Step 3: Client-Server Encryption Analysis 
1. Upload another file (confidential.docx) to CloudMe. 
2. Open the CloudMe desktop app settings and enable encryption (if available). 
3. Check if the file is encrypted before upload using a local encryption tool (e.g., VeraCrypt). 
4. Download the file from another device and verify that it requires decryption before opening. 
Step 4: Transport Security & Threat Analysis 
1. Log in to CloudMe from different devices (PC, mobile). 
2. Check if CloudMe uses HTTPS (SSL/TLS encryption) by observing the browser’s lock icon in the 
URL bar. 
3. (Optional) Use Wireshark to capture network packets and verify that file transfers are encrypted 
in transit. 
4. Attempt multiple failed logins to see if CloudMe locks the account (protection against brute
force attacks). 
Expected Outcome: 
✅ File Synchronization: CloudMe ensures files are automatically updated across devices. 
✅ Secure File Sharing: Password protection prevents unauthorized access. 
✅ Client-Server Encryption: Ensures files remain private during upload/download. 
✅ Transport Security: HTTPS encryption prevents eavesdropping. 
✅ Threat Protection: CloudMe implements account security features against unauthorized 
access.
