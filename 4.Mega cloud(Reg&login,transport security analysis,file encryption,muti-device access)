To demonstrate cloud security aspects such as registration and login, transport security, 
encryption, file sharing, multi-device access, update functionality, and server location using 
MEGA Cloud Storage, which offers built-in end-to-end encryption. 
Cloud Service Used: 
✅ MEGA Cloud Storage (Sign up here) 
 Offers zero-knowledge encryption (end-to-end encryption by default). 
 Supports secure file sharing with encryption keys. 
 Available on multiple devices (PC, mobile, browser). 
Software & Tools Required: 
 MEGA Cloud Account 
 MEGA Desktop & Mobile Apps (for multi-device access) 
 Wireshark (optional, for transport security analysis) 
Experiment Steps: 
Step 1: Registration and Login Security 
1. Go to MEGA and create an account with an email and a strong password. 
2. Verify that two-factor authentication (2FA) can be enabled for additional security. 
3. Try logging in from another browser/device to observe authentication behavior. 
Step 2: Transport Security Analysis (HTTPS Encryption) 
1. Open MEGA Web App and log in. 
2. Check the browser address bar—verify that MEGA uses HTTPS (SSL/TLS encryption) for secure 
communication. 
3. (Optional) Use Wireshark to capture packets and confirm that data is encrypted in transit. 
Step 3: File Encryption & Secure Sharing 
1. Upload a file (confidential.pdf) to MEGA. 
2. Right-click the file and select “Get Link” → Observe that the link includes an encryption key. 
3. Share the file without the key and verify that the recipient cannot access it without the 
decryption key. 
Step 4: Multi-Device Access 
1. Install MEGA Desktop Client on a PC/laptop and sync files. 
2. Install MEGA Mobile App and log in. 
3. Upload a file from one device and verify that it syncs across all devices automatically. 
Step 5: Update Functionality & Server Location 
1. Check MEGA’s server location under Account → Settings. 
2. Observe how MEGA automatically updates files across devices when modified.
