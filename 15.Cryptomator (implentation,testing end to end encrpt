15. Implementing and Testing End-to-End Encryption in Cloud Storage 
using Cryptomator 
Objective: 
To encrypt files before uploading them to a cloud storage service using Cryptomator and verify 
the encryption effectiveness. 
Prerequisites: 
✅ Windows PC with Admin Privileges 
✅ Cryptomator Installed (Download here: https://cryptomator.org/) 
✅ A cloud storage account (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.) 
✅ Some test files to encrypt and upload 
Experiment Steps 
Step 1: Download and Install Cryptomator 
1. Go to the official Cryptomator website: https://cryptomator.org/. 
2. Download the Windows version of Cryptomator. 
3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. 
4. Open Cryptomator after installation. 
Step 2: Create an Encrypted Vault 
1. Click + Add Vault in the Cryptomator interface. 
2. Select Create New Vault and choose a name for the vault (e.g., "SecureFiles"). 
3. Choose a folder location where the encrypted vault will be stored. 
o This should be inside your cloud storage folder (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, or 
OneDrive). 
4. Set a strong password for the vault (this password will be required to decrypt files). 
5. Click Create Vault, then Unlock Vault to mount it as a virtual drive. 
Step 3: Encrypt Files Using Cryptomator 
1. After unlocking the vault, it will appear as a virtual drive in Windows Explorer. 
2. Copy or move files into the Cryptomator virtual drive. 
3. Close the Cryptomator window or click Lock Vault to encrypt the contents. 
4. The files will now be securely encrypted within the cloud storage folder. 
Step 4: Upload the Encrypted Vault to Cloud Storage 
1. Ensure your cloud storage sync client (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive) is running. 
2. The encrypted Cryptomator vault will be automatically uploaded to the cloud. 
3. Check your cloud storage to confirm the encrypted files are stored. 
Step 5: Verify Encryption Effectiveness 
1. Attempt to open the encrypted vault files directly from cloud storage (they should be 
unreadable). 
2. Try accessing the Cryptomator vault with an incorrect password (it should deny access). 
3. Unlock the vault using Cryptomator and check if the original files are accessible. 
Testing and Verification 
1. Detecting Encryption Security 
✅ Check if files inside the vault appear as unreadable when accessed from cloud storage. 
✅ Ensure that the vault does not reveal original filenames or file contents. 
✅ Confirm that only the correct Cryptomator password can decrypt the files. 
2. User Awareness & Security Best Practices 
✅ Use a strong, unique password for the Cryptomator vault. 
✅ Backup the vault password securely (Cryptomator does not provide password recovery). 
✅ Regularly update Cryptomator and your cloud storage security settings. 
Expected Outcome: 
✅ Files stored in the cloud are securely encrypted and unreadable without the correct password. 
✅ Users can protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. 
✅ The encryption process ensures data privacy even if cloud storage is compromised.
