13. Recovering Deleted or Lost OneDrive Data Using Recuva 
Objective: 
To demonstrate how to recover permanently deleted or lost OneDrive files using Recuva, a 
file recovery tool, when OneDrive is synced to a local computer. 
Prerequisites: 
✅ A Microsoft OneDrive account 
✅ OneDrive desktop application installed & synced 
✅ Recuva software (Download from Piriform) 
✅ Windows PC with local OneDrive folder 
Experiment Steps 
Step 1: Setup OneDrive & Verify Sync 
1. Ensure OneDrive is installed & logged in on your PC. 
2. Check the local OneDrive folder (default location: C:\Users\YourName\OneDrive). 
3. Upload test files (e.g., testfile.docx, testimage.jpg) to OneDrive and confirm they are 
synced online. 
Step 2: Delete Files for Recovery Testing 
1. Delete a test file (testfile.docx) from the OneDrive folder. 
2. Remove it permanently (Shift + Delete) instead of sending it to the Recycle Bin. 
3. Verify deletion by checking online at OneDrive.com—the file should be removed. 
Step 3: Install and Run Recuva 
1. Download & Install Recuva from Piriform. 
2. Open Recuva and select File Recovery Mode. 
Step 4: Scan for Deleted OneDrive Files 
1. Select file type (Documents, Images, or All Files). 
2. Choose the location: 
o Select the OneDrive folder: 
bash 
CopyEdit 
C:\Users\YourName\OneDrive 
3. Click Start Scan and wait for the results. 
4. Analyze scan results: 
o Green files → Fully recoverable. 
o Yellow files → Partially recoverable (corrupted). 
o Red files → Unrecoverable. 
5. Select the file and click Recover. 
6. Save the recovered file to a different location (not OneDrive). 
Step 5: Verify OneDrive Sync & Restore 
1. Move the recovered file back to the OneDrive folder. 
2. Check if OneDrive re-uploads the file automatically. 
3. Test OneDrive’s built-in version history feature: 
o Right-click the file in OneDrive → View version history. 
o Restore an older version if available. 
Expected Outcome: 
✅ Recuva should successfully recover recently deleted OneDrive files from local storage. 
✅ If version history is enabled, older versions can be restored directly from OneDrive. 
✅ If a file is overwritten, only partial recovery may be possible.
