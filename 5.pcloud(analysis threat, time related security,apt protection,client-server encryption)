Objective: 
5. Security Analysis of Cloud Storage Devices using pCloud 
To analyze security threats, time-related aspects, advanced persistent threats (APT), and 
client-server encryption in a cloud storage environment using pCloud, a secure cloud storage 
provider with built-in encryption features. 
Cloud Service Used: 
✅ pCloud (Sign up for Free) 
 Provides client-side encryption (with pCloud Crypto). 
 Stores files in secure EU or US-based servers. 
 Supports zero-knowledge encryption (for premium users). 
Software & Tools Required: 
 pCloud Web Interface 
 pCloud Desktop App (for Client-Server Encryption Analysis) 
 Wireshark (for Network Traffic Monitoring, optional) 
Experiment Steps: 
Step 1: Analysis of Cloud Storage Threats 
1. Upload a file (confidential.txt) to pCloud. 
2. Share the file using a public link and verify that anyone with the link can access it (potential 
data leakage). 
3. Enable password protection for the shared link and verify that unauthorized users cannot 
access it. 
Step 2: Time-Related Aspects of Cloud Security 
1. Modify the uploaded file (confidential.txt) on your local system. 
2. Observe how quickly pCloud synchronizes the changes across devices. 
3. Check file version history in pCloud to see older versions of the file (important for rollback & 
data recovery). 
4. Test file expiration by setting an expiry date for a shared link and verify if access is revoked 
automatically. 
Step 3: Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Simulation 
1. Use an old password and attempt multiple failed logins → pCloud will lock the account 
temporarily after multiple incorrect attempts (prevention of brute-force attacks). 
2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) under settings. 
3. Try logging in from an unrecognized device → pCloud will prompt for extra verification. 
4. Observe the login activity logs in pCloud for signs of suspicious access attempts. 
Step 4: Client-Server Encryption Analysis 
1. Upload a file to pCloud Crypto (if available) and verify that the file is encrypted locally before 
upload. 
2. Download Wireshark (optional) and monitor network traffic while uploading/downloading a 
file. 
o If encryption is enabled, you should see TLS-encrypted traffic instead of plaintext data. 
3. Verify server-side encryption by checking pCloud’s security policy (data is stored in AES-256 
encrypted format). 
Expected Outcome: 
✅ Threat Analysis: File sharing without security can lead to data leaks, but password protection 
mitigates this risk. 
✅ Time-Related Security: Cloud storage offers version history and automatic expiration for 
shared links. 
✅ APT Protection: Security features like login activity logs, 2FA, and account lockouts prevent 
attacks. 
✅ Client-Server Encryption: pCloud Crypto ensures end-to-end encryption, making files 
unreadable on pCloud servers.
