Objective: 
7. File Synchronization & Sharing Using Dropbox 
To demonstrate file synchronization, backup, multi-device access, and secure file sharing 
using Dropbox. 
Software & Tools Required: 
 Dropbox Web Interface (https://www.dropbox.com/) 
 Dropbox Desktop Application (Download here) 
 Two devices for testing synchronization (e.g., Laptop + Mobile Phone) 
Experiment Steps: 
Step 1: Dropbox Account Setup & Installation 
1. Create a Dropbox Account: 
o Visit Dropbox Sign-Up Page. 
o Enter name, email, and password, then click Sign Up. 
o Verify your email by clicking the confirmation link sent to your inbox. 
2. Download and Install Dropbox App (Optional but Recommended): 
o Go to Dropbox Download Page. 
o Download and install the Dropbox Desktop Application for your OS. 
o Sign in to your Dropbox account after installation. 
Step 2: File Synchronization Across Devices 
1. Upload a File from the Web Interface: 
o Log in to Dropbox Web. 
o Click Upload Files and select a file (e.g., TestFile.txt). 
o Wait for the upload to complete. 
2. Verify Synchronization on Another Device: 
o Open the Dropbox folder on your desktop (if installed). 
o Check if the uploaded file (TestFile.txt) appears automatically. 
o If using a mobile device, open the Dropbox mobile app and check if the file is available. 
3. Modify the File on One Device & Sync the Changes: 
o Open TestFile.txt from the Dropbox folder on your PC. 
o Add some text (e.g., "Updated on PC") and save the file. 
o Wait a few seconds, then check if the modified file is updated on Dropbox Web and 
mobile app. 
4. Delete a File and Restore It from Dropbox Version History: 
o Delete TestFile.txt from your Dropbox folder on your desktop. 
o Log in to Dropbox Web, go to Deleted Files, and click Restore. 
o Check if the file reappears in your Dropbox folder. 
Step 3: Secure File Sharing 
1. Generate a Shareable Link: 
o Right-click on TestFile.txt in Dropbox Web and select Share. 
o Click Copy Link and share it with another user or test by opening it in an incognito 
browser. 
2. Set File Permissions for Security: 
o In the Share settings, change permissions to: 
 "Anyone with the link can view" (default). 
 "Invite specific people" (only certain users can access). 
 "Add password protection" (Premium feature). 
3. Test File Access on a Different Device: 
o Open the shared link on another device or browser. 
o Verify if the file is accessible only to authorized users. 
Expected Outcome: 
✅ File synchronization works across devices in real time. 
✅ Modified files are updated automatically. 
✅ Deleted files can be recovered using version history. 
✅ Secure file sharing with permission control.
