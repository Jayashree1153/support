Step 1: Upload an Initial File to Dropbox 
1. Log in to Dropbox at https://www.dropbox.com/. 
2. Click on Upload Files, select a text file (testfile.txt), and upload it. 
3. Verify that the file appears in your Dropbox folder. 
Step 2: Modify the File Multiple Times 
1. Edit the file on your local machine. 
o Add some text (e.g., “Version 2 - Updated content”) and save it. 
2. Re-upload the file to Dropbox, replacing the existing version. 
3. Repeat this process at least three times to create multiple file versions. 
Step 3: Access File Version History 
1. Locate the file in your Dropbox folder. 
2. Right-click on the file and select Version history. 
3. A list of all previous versions appears. Click on each version to preview or restore it. 
Step 4: Restore an Older Version 
1. In the Version history window, choose an older version of the file. 
2. Click Restore to replace the latest version with the selected one. 
3. Open the restored file and verify that it contains the older content. 
Step 5: Test Deleted File Recovery
