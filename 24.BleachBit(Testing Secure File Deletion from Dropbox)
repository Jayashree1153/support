24. Testing Secure File Deletion from Dropbox Cloud Storage Using BleachBit
Objective: Learn how to securely delete files from Dropbox cloud storage using BleachBit,
ensuring data cannot be recovered.
Prerequisites:
✅ Windows PC with Dropbox installed (Download here)
✅ Dropbox account with some uploaded test files
✅ BleachBit tool installed (Download here)
Experiment Steps
Step 1: Upload Test Files to Dropbox
1. Open Dropbox (web or desktop client).
2. Upload a test file (e.g., TestFile.txt).
3. Ensure the file syncs with the cloud by checking Dropbox online.
Step 2: Delete the File from Dropbox Normally
1. Locate TestFile.txt in Dropbox.
2. Right-click and select Delete.
3. Go to Dropbox Trash and delete the file permanently.
✅ Issue: Regular deletion only removes the reference to the file; data may still be recoverable.
Step 3: Secure File Deletion Using BleachBit
1. Open BleachBit on your Windows PC.
2. Click File > Shred Files.
3. Select your Dropbox folder (C:\Users\YourName\Dropbox).
4. Choose the deleted file and click Shred.
5. BleachBit will overwrite the file’s disk space, making recovery impossible.
Step 4: Verify Secure Deletion
1. Use file recovery software (e.g., Recuva) to check if the file can be recovered.
2. If properly shredded, the file should not appear in the recovery scan.
Testing and Verification
✅ Check Dropbox Trash: Ensure the file is permanently deleted.
✅ Run a file recovery scan: Verify that the file is irretrievable.
✅ Check Dropbox sync: Ensure secure deletion does not affect other files.
Expected Outcome:
✅ Successfully shredded and securely deleted files from Dropbox.
✅ Verified that deleted files are non-recoverable.
✅ Ensured Dropbox continues normal operation after secure deletion.
